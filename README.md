# Forza Leveling Automation

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of leveling up in Forza by simulating key presses at regular intervals. It serves as a workaround for the time-consuming leveling system in Forza, allowing players with busy schedules or real jobs to progress more efficiently.

## Description

Forza Horizon has introduced a new leveling system that can be time-consuming, especially for players with limited time to dedicate to gaming. This script automates the repetitive task of leveling up by simulating key presses (in this case, pressing the "D" key) at regular intervals. The goal is to provide a solution for players who want to progress in the game without having to spend excessive time in front of their screens.

## How does it work?

The program will open and you can press 'Start' or 'Stop' to get the program to either start or stop at any time. Any time 'D' is pressed, it will get logged.
